                <p> This website is the completion of my React-Redux Project with the Per Scholas Software Engineering Course.</p> 

                <p> My passion has always been learning, so I've attempted to make all of my projects for this course educational. </p>

                <p> There are 3 quizzes on this website. If you click one of the links in the menu you can try your hand at one.</p>

                <p> As with much of coding, I did a lot of research and was able to get guidance and key tricks from various websites. You can check those out on the Resources page.</p>

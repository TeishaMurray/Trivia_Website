# Test Your Knowledge

Learning programming languages can be both exciting and frustrating. Everyday there are more and more interactive websites to make this learning experience more enjoyable. While repetition is a good practice for learning to code, it relies heavily on your short-term memory and recognition. Quizzing yourself on your knowledge can help to ensure you have the information stored well within your long-term memory loop because it relies on your ability to recall the information.

I developed a website that provides short quizzes on basic information for three common coding languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive website would be a great tool for teens who are learning to code. Additionally, older and/or more advanced learners could use this repository and expand on these quizzes to test deeper knowledge and understanding software engineering. This could be done by adding more questions, making the questions more complex, or even adding more programming language quizzes.
